**Unit 2: Cellular Structure** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will discuss the basic unit of life, the cell. You will study
the eukaryotic cell’s outer layer, the plasma (cell) membrane. The
cell’s interior organs, known as organelles, will be identified and
examined, including the cell’s control center known as the nucleus. To
understand how cells work together in the microscopic environment, it is
imperative that you know basic cell structure.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 8 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 4 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   identify the organelles within a eukaryotic cell and list the basic
    function of each; and
-   compare and contrast meiosis and mitosis, identifying the steps of
    each in microscopic images.

    and Adobe Flash)  
        
     Instructions: Read the text and study the beautiful images and
    animation that are included. Also, note the size of the organelles.
    Do not forget nanometer is 10<sup>-9</sup> and micrometer (micron)
    is 10<sup>-6</sup>. Which one is smaller? The nanometer is smaller,
    because the negative before the exponent tells you to move the
    decimal point to the left and the number tells you how many places.
    Once you feel that you have mastered the material, make sure that
    you can answer the “Got It” questions at the bottom of the
    page.

     Instructions: This interactive model will allow you to drag your
    cursor over different organelles in a typical animal cell. The
    organelle will be identified and its function described. Once you
    feel confident that you have mastered the anatomy of the cell's
    organelles, click the next button to take an interactive quiz. Keep
    working through this activity until you have mastered the cellular
    organelles.

     Instructions: In order for tissues to remain viable and healthy,
    old worn out cells must be replaced with new healthy cells. This
    reading discusses mitosis (cell division resulting in two cells each
    with two copies of each chromosome) and meiosis (the process that
    reshuffles genetic information and produces the egg and sperm that
    contain one copy of each chromosome). Check your knowledge with the
    “Got It” questions at the bottom of the page.

     Instructions: Click on the virtual scope. We have used this tool
    before in subunit 1.2, but if you need a refresher, work through the
    tutorial. Put the onion root slide on the scope. This slide will
    allow you to observe the various phases of mitosis. Use what you
    have learned about mitosis to view the various stages in these
    cells. You should be able to identify prophase (chromosomes first
    become visible), metaphase (chromosomes meet in the middle),
    anaphase (chromosomes separate), telophase (nuclear membrane forms
    around chromosomes, chromosomes spread out, spindle breaks down),
    and cytokinesis (pinching in of cytoplasm and complete cell
    division). If you are able to find all stages, great job as you have
    mastered microscopy and mitosis!
