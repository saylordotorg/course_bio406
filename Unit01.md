title: "BIO406: Microscopic Anatomy"
course_description: "An exploration of cells and tissues at the microscopic level, using a virtual microscope to view features that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Focuses on special features of various body systems, including the circulatory, renal, skeletal, lymphatic, respiratory, integumentary, endocrine, and reproductive systems."

**Unit 1: Microsopy and Microscopic Anatomy** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will study the microscope and how it relates to cells
and microscopic anatomy. If the microscope was not invented, the world
of microscopic anatomy, as we know it, would not exist. One of the most
important skills required to study microscopic anatomy is use of the
microscope. First, we you will be introduced to the microscopic world
and the history of how it began. Then, we will use the virtual
microscope to explore and apply basic microscope techniques and
principles.  *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 5 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   differentiate between the types of microscopy and describe the
    importance of microscopes in microscopic anatomy; and
-   correctly use the compound light microscope with a working knowledge
    of the function of each part.

    to also click on the hyperlinks for terms and concepts to help
    enhance your reading.  
        
     Note on the Text: This reading introduces the idea of using the
    microscope to study cells. Without the use of a microscope, there
    would be no microscopic anatomy.

     Instructions: Watch the instructional video, which introduces you
    to the microscope and its parts. To access the video, click on the
    hyperlink for “Quicktime” or “Flash Video.” Next, click on the
    hyperlink for the virtual scope. Since this is likely your first
    time using this tool, complete the tutorial, which gives clear
    instructions on how to use the various features. This is an
    excellent model of the real thing!   
                  
     Start with the slide titled “letter e,” which is a clip of an
    actual *e*from a newspaper. Place the slide on the stage with the
    image placed directly below the lowest power objective (4X). Once
    you have the slide on the stage in the correct place, you will want
    to switch views so that you are looking through the oculars. At this
    point, you will need to adjust the focus using the coarse adjustment
    knob. Once you have a clear view of your image, switch the
    objectives to higher magnification, using only the fine focus to
    adjust the clarity of the image. The *e*image allows you to observe
    how the orientation changes when using the microscope. An *e*in the
    correct orientation off the microscope will be upside down and
    backwards under the microscope. This is due to the two lens system
    – the oculars at 10X magnification and the objectives at variable
    magnifications. Also, notice that image stays in the center
    (parcenter) and for the most part focused (parfocal) as you go to
    higher objective magnifications. You are simply focusing in on one
    section of the *e*or image.   
                  
     The onion root slide will allow you to observe the various phases
    of mitosis. We will skip it for now. When you study mitosis later in
    this course, we will revisit this site to view the onion root
    tip.   
          
     The cheek smear is known as a wet mount and is made by scraping the
    interior of the cheek gently with a toothpick and then smearing it
    onto a slide with stain and covering with a coverslip. A wet mount
    is simply a scraping or swab of the sample that is placed on a slide
    sometimes in a small amount of water, covered with a thin piece of
    glass (coverslip), and stained. This is different from prepared
    slides that are pieces of sample (tissue) cut very thinly
    (sections), placed on the slide, and stained.
