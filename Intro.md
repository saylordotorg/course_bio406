In this course, you will study microscopic anatomy. The study of the
structure of a cell, tissue, organ, or related feature is known as
anatomy. Gross anatomy (or macroscopic anatomy) involves examining
anatomical structures that can be seen with the naked eye, whereas
microscopic anatomy is the examination of minute anatomical structures
that cannot be observed without the help of visual enhancement, such as
a microscope. The terms microscopic anatomy and histology (the study of
microscopic structure of animal and plant tissue) are used
interchangeably. Many times it will be necessary to survey gross anatomy
so that when you focus in on the microscopic anatomy you will have a
geographical idea of the location within the body. This course makes use
of microscope slides of anatomical structures to aid in the discussions
of anatomy. Unit 1 begins with an overview of basic cell structure. The
study of cells is known as cytology. Cells contain numerous structures
that can only be seen with the aid of specialized microscopy. These
structures include the central command center known as the nucleus,
where DNA is housed, duplicated, and translated into RNA. Other
structures, known as organelles, include the powerhouse of the cell
called the mitochondria, the ribosomes, which are central in protein
synthesis, and the Golgi apparatus, which is often thought of as the
protein packaging plant. The endoplasmic reticulum may be studded with
ribosomes (rough) or lack ribosomes (smooth). Rough endoplasmic
reticulum is the site of protein synthesis and modification, whereas
smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in lipid and steroid synthesis,
carbohydrate metabolism, calcium regulation, and detoxification. You
will learn how single cells come together to make up tissues in Unit 2.
You will examine epithelial, connective, nervous, and muscle tissue.
Epithelial tissue provides the interior lining and covers the exterior
surface of most of our body’s organs including the skin. There are
several types of connective tissue. Some connective tissue types are
made up of collagen, elastic, and/or reticular fibers in a strong, yet
somewhat flexible matrix. Other connective tissue types are fairly hard,
such as bone, or may be liquid, such as blood. After looking at the
tissue types, you will study each of the organ systems in the body,
understanding how these tissues fit together structurally to form organs
and organ systems that carry out specific functions. You will find
information in Unit 3 that overlaps with what you have already learned
in Unit 2. This should not surprise you, because all of the organs and
organ systems in the body are made up of the four basic tissue types.
Microscopic anatomy is an important part of overall anatomical study.
Almost all of the body's processes that occur on the gross level
(observable by the naked eye) are based upon anatomical features at the
microscopic level. By studying the structure of an organ or tissue and
knowing what is considered normal, it makes it easier to identify
abnormal features and also to understand the mechanisms that underlie
pathology.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

-   differentiate among the types of microscopy and describe the
    importance of microscopes in microscopic anatomy;
-   correctly use the compound light microscope with a working knowledge
    of the function of each part;
-   identify the organelles within a eukaryotic cell and list the basic
    function of each;
-   compare and contrast meiosis and mitosis, identifying the steps of
    each in microscopic images;
-   outline what makes each epithelial, connective, nervous, and muscle
    tissue unique, where each is found within the body, and how each
    interacts with other tissue types;
-   point out circulatory system features, including intercalated disks
    and valves, as well as the differences among different vessel types;
-   identify the cells found in blood and the role of each;
-   define how the tissues and anatomical features that make up the
    gastrointestinal and respiratory systems come together structurally
    to support the function of these organ systems;
-   identify the features of the epidermis and dermis of the skin,
    including the cells, layers, glands, and other features of each
    layer;
-   explain how the structural arrangement of the lymphatic system and
    lymph node supports its physiological role of filtering;
-   compare and contrast the structural arrangement of spongy and
    compact bone;
-   map out the path of plasma filtrate as it moves through the neuron
    and into the ureter, bladder, and urethra, identifying what types of
    cells are located in each part;
-   describe the basic structure of endocrine organs, including the
    reproductive organs; and
-   identify what features make special senses tissue unique.

### Course Information

**Welcome to BIO406!**

Below, please find some general information on the course and its
requirements.

**Course Designer**: Amy L. Thompson, PhD, MLS (ASCP)

**Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   University of Delaware Department of Biological Sciences’
    “[Microscopy
    Pre-Lab](http://www.udel.edu/biology/ketcham/microscope/scope.html) [Activities](http://www.udel.edu/biology/ketcham/microscope/scope.html)”
-   National Institute of General Medical Sciences’ “[An Owner's Guide
    to the
    Cell](http://publications.nigms.nih.gov/insidethecell/chapter1.html)”
-   The Ohio State University at Lima’s “[Histology Study
    Page](http://www.lima.ohio-state.edu/biology/archive/anatomy.htm)”
-   [Anatomy Atlases](http://www.anatomyatlases.org/)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more exploratory material presented in the latter
units. You will also need to complete the following:  
  
             - Unit 1.2 Lab Exercise  
             - Unit 2.1 Assessment             
             - Unit 2.2 Lab Exercise  
             - Unit 3.5: Assessment  
             - Unit 4.5: Assessment  
             - The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.

In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.
If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of 82 hours to
complete. Each unit contains a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time that you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help
you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. Use the
time advisories to help you plot out your schedule of when you do each
unit/subunit and on which days of the week.

**Tips/Suggestions**: It is important that you take notes for all
readings, lectures, and learning tasks. When available, you may choose
to print out articles and take notes directly on them. You may want to
use the course units and their subunits to create an outline for your
notes.
