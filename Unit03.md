title: "BIO406: Microscopic Anatomy"
course_description: "An exploration of cells and tissues at the microscopic level, using a virtual microscope to view features that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Focuses on special features of various body systems, including the circulatory, renal, skeletal, lymphatic, respiratory, integumentary, endocrine, and reproductive systems."

##Unit 3: Tissue

*In this unit, we will examine the four types of tissue that make up all
of the organs and organ systems of the body. These include epithelial,
connective, muscle, and nervous tissue. We will discuss how these
tissues are similar and different. As you work through this unit, think
about where in the body these tissues are located and how they might
work together to carry out a common function.  *

###Unit 3 Time Advisory
This unit will take approximately 18 hours to complete.  
  
 * Subunit 3.1: 4 hours  
 * Subunit 3.2: 4 hours  
 * Subunit 3.3: 4 hours  
 * Subunit 3.4: 4 hours  
 * Subunit 3.5: 2 hours

###Unit3 Learning Outcomes  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
 * outline what makes each epithelial, connective, nervous, and muscle
   tissue unique; and
 * identify where epithelial, connective, nervous, and muscle tissues
   are found within the body and how each interacts with other tissue
   types.

###3.1 Epithelial Tissue
*NOTE: Epithelial tissue is named based on shape: squamous (flat),
cuboidal (cube shaped), or columnar (column shaped) and the number of
layers: simple (one layer), stratified (layered), or pseudostratified
(one layer that looks like several layers).*

overview of connective tissue, including its cells and fibers, where
it is found, and the various types. It seems like a lot of material,
but learning all of this now will better prepare you when you
encounter connective tissue making up organs and organ systems. Note
that Dr. King is an Associate Professor in the Department of Zoology
and the Department of Anatomy at Southern Illinois University,
Carbondale.

###3.4 Nervous Tissue
*NOTE: The neuron is the nervous system cell responsible for signaling.
The cell body, where the nucleus is found in the neuron, is known as the
soma. Short projections, known as dendrites, bring the signal into the
cell and a longer projection, known as the axon, carries the signal away
from the cell body.  *
