##Unit 4: Organs and Organ Systems

>>>>>>> 0f320e38efe3f7f44fbe9480497cafcc28f76ffe
*In this unit, we will examine the microscopic anatomy of the organ
systems that make up the body. Each system will be introduced with
histological features identified. It is sometimes necessary to
understand the function of the cell, tissue, or organ in order to make
the connection between anatomy and physiology (structure and function).
Remember, that all of the organs and organ systems are comprised of the
four tissues *– *epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous *– *that we
just studied in the previous unit.   *

     Instructions: Watch Dr. Krause’s video lecture on blood and bone
    marrow.   
      
     Watching this video should take approximately 1 hour and 15
    minutes.  
        
     Note on the Lecture: This lecture does a great job of identifying
    the cells normally found in the blood. In blood there are leukocytes
    (white blood cells), erythrocytes (red blood cells), and platelets.
    There are five types of leukocytes. These include neutrophils,
    lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. Neutrophils are
    the most abundant and are elevated when a bacterial infection is
    present. Lymphocytes differentiate into B and T cells, which are
    important in the adaptive immune response including antibody
    production. They are the second most abundant cells. Dr. Krause also
    discusses the cells that are present during certain disease
    states.

pancreas (which has both endocrine and exocrine function), gastric
glands, salivary glands, and others.*

    explanations of each body part, as well as histology slides. Pay
    close attention to the tissues that make up the gastrointestinal
    tract and the special anatomical features of these tissues. Notice
    how the muscle type changes throughout the gastrointestinal tract
    and as with many of our other organ systems, simple squamous
    epithelial cells line their interior. Look at the special features
    of the epithelial tissue in the intestines.

     Instructions: Review the layers and regions, special features, and
    cell types of the gastrointestinal tract sections. There is a lot of
    material covered in this section. Start with the oral cavity then
    the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and large intestines to
    the anus. As you are reviewing the microscopic anatomy, think about
    where the accessory glands fit into this system. Once you complete
    this section, click on the hyperlinks for liver and glands. Focus on
    the bigger picture for the glands – how does each supply a fluid or
    substance that aids in the digestive process. For example, salivary
    glands secrete saliva for mechanical digestion (and since it
    contains amylase to break down starch – chemical digestion). In much
    of the intestines, Goblet cells secrete lubricating mucous. The
    liver also has a major role in digestion – producing bile to break
    down lipids and also serving in numerous other processes.

**4.4 Integumentary System** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*NOTE: The outermost layer of skin is the epidermis and is actually
several layers of both dead and living cells. It has a nerve supply but
no vascular (blood vessel) supply. The layer beneath the epidermis is
known as the dermis. This layer contains oil and sweat gland, as well as
the hair follicle and has both nerve and vascular supply.*

     Instructions: Watch this brief video that introduces the oil and
    sweat glands that are located in the dermis of the skin. The major
    type of sweat gland in most skin is the eccrine (sudiferous) sweat
    gland. Sweat secretion is very important for body temperature
    regulation. Sebaceous oil gland secretions help to lubricate the
    skin.

     Instructions: Watch this brief video lecture, which introduces the
    layers of the skin. Notice how the innermost epidermal layer, the
    stratum basale, carries out mitosis, whereas the outermost layer,
    the stratum granulosum is made up only of dead cells. The stratum
    lucidum is a special layer found only in thick skin found on the
    palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Beneath the epidermis is
    the dermis, which contains glands, hair follicles, nerve endings,
    and vascular (blood) supply.

     Instructions: Watch this brief video lecture that introduces the
    osteon, which makes up compact bone. Notice the distinct features of
    compact bone – the central canal with blood vessel supply surrounded
    by concentric rings (lamellae) containing osteocytes (mature bone
    cells) in little cocoons known as lacunae. The central blood vessel
    brings in the nutrients that must be distributed from the center out
    through projections known as canaliculi to each osteocyte in the
    concentric lamellae. Wastes are similarly brought back through this
    system to reach the blood vessel for removal.

**4.7 Renal System** <span id="4.7"></span> 
*NOTE: The renal (urinary) system includes the kidneys that filter blood
to make urine, the ureters that drain the kidneys (or nephrons) into the
bladder, the urinary bladder, and the urethra, which allows urine to
pass out of the body.* *The nephron’s glomerulus filters blood plasma
(the liquid part of the blood minus the red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets). The filtrate moves into the proximal convoluted
tubule, then the Loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule, before
finally making its way into the collecting duct. Distinct anatomical
differences exist in the various sections of the nephron depending upon
function.*

**4.8 Endocrine System** <span id="4.8"></span> 
*NOTE: The endocrine system is made up of a large number of organs and
glands that secrete hormones. This is a ductless system as the hormones
are secreted directly into the surrounding tissue and then make their
way to the bloodstream. Hormones travel in the blood until they find
their target tissue receptors. Unlike the nervous system, which rapidly
signals and has a short lived response, the endocrine system takes
longer to initiate a response, but this response is longer lived.*

     Instructions: This brief video introduces the anatomical features
    of the male reproductive system. Pay special attention to how the
    microscopic anatomy of each organ or tissue is important for overall
    structure and function.  
      
     Watching this video should take approximately 10 minutes.

    single left-facing arrow to move back.  
        
     Note on the Lecture: We already covered the nervous tissue and
    discussed the main nervous system cell, the neuron. It is also
    important that you have a good understanding of this system as a
    whole. This PowerPoint lecture set gives a good explanation of the
    parts of the nervous system, including the supportive cells of the
    nervous system known as glial cells.

     Instructions: Read the entire text linked above, using the arrows
    to click through each page.  
        
     Note on the Text: Like the nervous system, we have already covered
    aspects of the muscular system when we looked at muscle tissue. At
    this point, you should already know that cardiac muscle is
    exclusively found in the heart and smooth muscle is found lining
    hollow organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and bladder. The
    descriptor “muscular system” in scientific literature largely refers
    to skeletal muscle and it function. This reading focuses exclusively
    on skeletal muscle and provides a thorough overview of the
    microscopic anatomy of skeletal muscle.
